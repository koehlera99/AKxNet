Until the spell ends, the target can tread on air as if walking on solid ground. The target can move upward or downward at a 45 degree angle at half its speed. Treat strong winds (twenty miles per hour or more) as difficult terrain. If the spell ends while the target is airborne, it falls if this spell is the only thing keeping it aloft. At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th Level or higher, you can add one target for each Level above 4th. </description><spell></spell><name>Alarm</name><level>1st Level</level><school>abjuration (ritual)</school><time>Casting Time: 1 minute</time><range>Range: 25 feet</range><duration>Duration: 8 hours</duration><description>Choose a door, a window, or an area within Range that is no larger than a 20 foot cube. Until the spell ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a Tiny or larger creature touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the spell, you can designate creatures that won?t set off the alarm. Also, choose whether the alarm is mental or audible. A mental alarm alerts you with a psychic ping if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you from sleep. An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell for 10 seconds. Anyone within 50 feet of the warded area can hear the bell. Reduce the distance by 10 feet for each interposing closed door and by 20 feet for each interposing wall. Material Components: A tiny bell and a piece of fine silver wire. </description><spell></spell><name>Animal Friendship</name><level>1st Level</level><school>enchantment</school><time>Casting Time: 1 action</time><range>Range: 25 feet</range><duration>Duration: 24 hours</duration><description>This spell lets you show an animal or similar beast that you mean it no harm. Choose a beast within Range that can see and hear you. If the beast?s Intelligence is 4 or higher, the spell fails. Otherwise, the beast must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you until the spell ends. If you or one of your companions harms the target, the spells ends early. Material Components: A morsel of food the animal likes. </description><spell></spell><name>Animal Messenger</name><level>2nd Level</level><school>transmutation (ritual)</school><time>Casting Time: 1 action</time><range>Range: 25 feet</range><duration>Duration: 8 hours</duration><description>By means of this spell, you can use an animal to deliver a message. Choose a Tiny beast you can see within Range, such as a squirrel, a blue jay, or a bat. You specify a location, which you must have visited, and a recipient who matches a general description, such as ?a man or woman dressed in the uniform of the town guard? or ?a red haired dwarf.? You also speak a message of up to 25 words. The target beast travels as fast as it can to the specified location. When the animal arrives, it delivers your message to the creature that you described, replicating the sound of your voice. The messenger speaks only to a creature matching the description you gave.   If the messenger does not reach its destination before the spell ends, the message is lost. Material Components: A morsel of food the animal likes. </description><spell></spell><name>Animate Dead</name><level>3rd Level</level><school>necromancy</school><time>Casting Time: 1 minute</time><range>Range: 10 feet</range><duration>Duration: Instantaneous</duration><description>Choose a pile of bones or a corpse of a Medium or Small humanoid within Range. Your spell imbues the target with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an undead creature. The target becomes a skeleton if you chose bones or a zombie if you chose a corpse (the DM has the creature?s game statistics). The creature is under your control for 24 hours , after which it stops obeying any command you have given it. As part of your action, you can mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 50 feet of you. You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours , you must cast this spell on the creature before the current 24 hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over the creature, rather than animating a new creature. Animating the dead is not a good act, and only evil casters use this spell frequently. At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th Level or higher, you create or reassert control over one additional undead creature for each Level above 3rd. Each of the creatures must come from a different corpse or pile of bones. Material Components: A drop of blood, a piece of flesh, and a pinch of bone dust. </description><spell></spell><name>Antimagic Field</name><level>8th Level</level><school>abjuration</school><time>Casting Time: 1 action</time><range>Range: Self</range><duration>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour</duration><description>A 10 foot radius invisible cloud of antimagic surrounds you. This area is divorced from the weave of magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within the cloud, spells fizzle out, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the cloud moves with you, centered on you. Magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the cloud and cannot protrude into it. While an effect is suppressed, it does not function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its Duration. Targeted Effects: Spells and other magical effects, such as magic missile and charm person, that target a creature or an object in the cloud have no effect on that target. Areas of Magic: The area of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball, cannot extend into the cloud, and if the cloud overlaps an area of magic, the part of that area that is covered by the cloud is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the cloud, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough. Magic on Creatures and Objects: Any active magical effect on a creature or an object in the cloud is suppressed while the creature or object is in it. Magic Items: The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the cloud. For example, a +1 long sword in the cloud functions as a nonmagical long sword. A magic weapon?s properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the cloud or wielded by an attacker in the cloud. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the cloud (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the cloud), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits. Magical Travel: Teleportation fails to work in the cloud, whether the cloud is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another world or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space, such as that created by a rope trick spell, temporarily closes while in the cloud. Summoned Creatures: A creature summoned by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the cloud. Such a creature instantly reappears   once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the cloud. Dispel Magic: Spells and magical effects such as dispel magic and greater dispel magic have no effect on the cloud. Likewise, the clouds created by different antimagic fields do not nullify each other. Material Components: A pinch of powdered iron or iron filings. </description><spell></spell><name>Arcane Eye</name><level>4th Level</level><school>divination</school><time>Casting Time: 1 action</time><range>Range: 25 feet</range><duration>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour</duration><description>You create an invisible, magical eye within Range that hovers in the air for the Duration. You mentally receive visual information from the eye, which has normal vision and darkvision out to 10 feet. The eye can look in every direction. As an action, you can move the eye up to 30 feet in any direction. There is no limit to how far away from you the eye can move, but it cannot enter another plane of existence. A solid barrier blocks the eye?s movement, but the eye can pass through an opening as small as 1 inch in diameter. Material Components: A bit of bat fur. </description><spell></spell><name>Arcane Gate</name><level>6th Level</level><school>conjuration</school><time>Casting Time: 1 action</time><range>Range: 500 feet</range><duration>Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes</duration><description>Choose two points on the ground that you can see, one point within 10 feet of you and one point within 500 feet of you. A circular portal, 10 feet in diameter, opens over each point. The portals are two dimensional glowing rings filled with mist, hovering inches from the ground and perpendicular to it at the points you choose. The portals remain open for the Duration. Any creature or object entering one portal exits from the other portal as if the two were adjacent to each other. The mist that fills each portal prevents vision through it. </description><spell></spell><name>Arcane Lock</name><level>2nd Level</level><school>abjuration</school><time>Casting Time: 1 action</time><range>Range: Touch</range><duration>Duration: Permanent</duration><description>Touch a door, window, gate, chest, or other entryway that is closed. The chosen object is locked for the Duration. You and the creatures you designate when you cast this spell can open the object normally. Otherwise, it is impassable until it is broken or the spell is dispelled or suppressed. Casting knock on the object suppresses arcane lock for 10 minutes. While affected by this spell, the object is more difficult to break; the DC to break it increases by 10. Material Components: Gold dust worth at least 25 gp</description><spell></spell><name>Astral Projection</name><level>9th Level</level><school>necromancy</school><time>Casting Time: 1 hour</time><range>Range: 10 feet</range><duration>Duration: Permanent</duration><description>You and up to eight willing creatures within Range project your astral bodies into the Astral Plane. The material body you leave behind is unconscious and in a state of suspended animation; it does not need food or air and does not age. Your astral body resembles your mortal form in almost every way, replicating your game statistics and possessions. The principal difference is the addition of a silvery cord that extends out from between your shoulder blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after 1 foot. This cord is your tether to your material body. As long as the tether remains intact, you can find your way home. If the cord is cut? something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it does?your soul and body are separated, killing you instantly. Your astral form can freely travel through the Astral Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any other plane. If you enter a new plane, your astral form disappears, and you gain a body capable of surviving on the plane you   visit. Your game statistics do not change. If you return to the Astral Plane by casting this spell again, or by some other means, the body created for the plane you visited disappears, and your astral body reappears. The spell ends for you and your companions when you use your action to end it. When the spell ends, the affected creature returns to its physical body, and it awakens. The spell might also end prematurely for you or one of your companions. A successful dispel magic or greater dispel magic used against an astral or physical body ends the spell for that creature. And if a creature?s second body or its astral form is reduced to 0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature. The silver cord returns to the creature?s body where it rests, reviving it from its state of suspended animation. If you are returned to your body prematurely, your companions remain in their astral forms and must find their own way back to their bodies, usually by dropping to 0 hit points. Material Components: For each creature you will affect with this spell, you must provide a jacinth worth at least 1,000 gp and one ornately carved bar of silver worth at least 100 gp. </description><spell></spell><name>Augury</name><level>2nd Level</level><school>divination (ritual)</school><time>Casting Time: 1 minute</time><range>Range: Self</range><duration>Duration: Instantaneous</duration><description>Describe a course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes.

The DM chooses from the following possible answers:    Weal, for good results    Woe, for bad results    Weal and woe, for both good and bad results    Nothing, for results that are not especially good or bad The spell does not take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion. If you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a 25 percent chance on each casting after the first that you get a false reading.

Each creature in the affected area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and becomes buried in the rubble. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and does not fall prone or become buried. A creature buried in rubble cannot move and might not be able to see or hear beyond the  2 rubble. For each full minute the creature spends buried, it takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage. A buried creature can spend one minute to make a Strength check to try to dig out of the rubble. The DM sets the DC based on the material: DC 15 is appropriate for a typical mixture of earth and stone. On a successful check, the creature digs itself free. Another creature can spend a minute to dig out a creature buried in rubble. The DM might decide that digging out from the rubble takes more than a minute, depending on the amount of rubble involved. For example, a structure that has entirely collapsed produces more rubble than a ceiling that has simply dropped debris. Cliff: If the spell?s area touches or includes a vertical surface, such as a cliff, that does not have a ceiling, the vertical surface crumbles away and becomes a landslide. The landslide pushes out from the affected surface horizontally as far as it falls vertically. For example, if the affected area is 100 feet tall, the landslide spreads out 100 feet from the cliff?s base in any direction where its path is unobstructed. The landslide begins at the start of your turn after you cast the spell. Each creature in the landslide?s path is affected by falling rubble (see above). If a creature successfully saves against the rubble, the landslide moves the creature along with it in a straight line away from the vertical surface to a space on the slide?s leading edge. Structures: The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses. </description><spell></spell><name>Elemental Mantle</name><level>3rd Level</level><school>transmutation</school><time>Casting Time: 1 action</time><range>Range: Self</range><duration>Duration: 10 minutes</duration><description>Wrapping yourself in power from the Elemental Planes, you assume an elemental mantle For the Duration.

The image appears at a spot within Range and lasts For the Duration. The image seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You cannot create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a troglodyte?s stench). Any physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC. You can use your action to cause the image to move to any spot within Range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.

Every willing creature within the sphere when it appears becomes invisible. Affected creatures can see each other, and themselves, as if unaffected by the spell. If any creature affected by this spell attacks or casts a spell that affects an enemy creature, the invisibility sphere ends.

The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell. However, a suggestion that a pool of acid is actually pure water and that a quick dip would be refreshing is another matter. Urging a band of orcs to stop attacking your party so that the orcs and party could jointly loot a rich treasure elsewhere is likewise a reasonable use of the spell?s power. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire Duration, such as in the case of the orc band mentioned above. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do. You can instead specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the Duration. For example, you might suggest that a group of soldiers give all their money to the first beggar they meet. If the condition is not met before the spell Duration expires, the activity is not performed.

You banish the target into an extradimensional labyrinth, a different plane of existence. The target remains there For the Duration or until it escapes the maze. To escape, the target must use its action to make an Intelligence check contested by your magic ability check. (A minotaur automatically wins this contest.) On a success, the target escapes and the spell ends. When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or, if that space is occupied, in the unoccupied space nearest its former space. </description><spell></spell><name>Meld into Stone</name><level>3rd Level</level><school>transmutation</school><time>Casting Time: 1 action</time><range>Range: Touch</range><duration>Duration: 8 hours</duration><description>Choose a point you can touch on a stone object or surface large enough to fully contain your volume. You can step into the stone at that point using your movement, melding yourself and all the equipment you carry with the stone For the Duration. Nothing of your presence remains visible or otherwise detectable by nonmagical senses. While merged with the stone, you cannot see what occurs outside it, and any Wisdom (Perception) checks you make to hear sounds outside it are made with disadvantage. You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while merged in the stone. You can use your movement to leave the stone where you entered it, which ends the spell.  7 Minor physical damage to the stone does not harm you, but its partial destruction or a change in its shape (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals you 6d6 bludgeoning damage. The stone?s complete destruction (or transmutation into a different substance) expels you and deals you 50 bludgeoning damage. If expelled, you fall prone in an open space closest to where you first entered. </description><spell></spell><name>Melf?s Acid Arrow</name><level>2nd Level</level><school>evocation</school><time>Casting Time: 1 action</time><range>Range: 100 feet</range><duration>Duration: Instantaneous</duration><description>A shimmering green arrow streaks toward a target within Range and bursts in a spray of acid.

A creature takes 6d6 fire damage and 6d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one fiery burst is affected only once. The spell damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that are not being worn or carried. </description><spell></spell><name>Minor Illusion - cantrip</name><school>Illusion </school><time>Casting Time: 1 action</time><range>Range: 25 feet</range><duration>Duration: 1 minute</duration><description>You create a ghost sound or a silent image within Range that lasts For the Duration or until you  8 dismiss it (no action required) or cast this spell again. If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC. Ghost Sound: You create a sound that originates from a point of your choice within Range. The sound?s volume can Range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else?s voice, a lion?s roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the Duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends. Silent Image: You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon at a spot within Range. The illusion does not create sound or any other effect aside from its image. The image must fit within a 10 foot cube. Any physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it. You can use your action to cause the image to move to any spot within 25 feet of you. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking as you move it.

Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it?s impossible to track which image is real. You can use your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates. Each time a creature targets you with an attack or a harmful spell while a duplicate remains, that creature randomly determines whether it targets you or one of the duplicates. If you have two duplicates, the creature targets a duplicate if it rolls 1?4 on a d6. If you have one duplicate, the creature targets a duplicate if it rolls 1?3 on a d6. A duplicate?s AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier, and it uses your saving throws. If an attack hits a duplicate, or if a duplicate fails a saving throw against an effect that deals hit point damage, the duplicate disappears. A creature is unaffected by this spell if it can?t see or if it relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight or tremorsense. </description><spell></spell><name>Moonbeam</name><level>2nd Level</level><school>evocation</school><time>Casting Time: 1 action</time><range>Range: 50 feet</range><duration>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</duration><description>A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5  foot radius, 40 foot high cylinder centered on a point within Range.

The creature must make a Constitution saving throw. Shapechangers make this saving throw with disadvantage. A creature takes 3d8 radiant damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. Shapechangers that fail the saving throw also instantly revert back to their natural forms and cannot assume different forms until they leave the spell?s light. On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action to move the beam 50 feet in any direction. At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd Level	or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each Levelabove 2nd. </description><spell></spell><name>Mordenkainen?s Sword</name><level>7th Level</level><school>evocation</school><time>Casting Time: 1 action</time><range>Range: 50 feet</range><duration>Duration: 1 minute</duration><description>You create a sword shaped plane of force that hovers within Range. It lasts For the Duration or until you cast this spell again. When the sword appears, it makes a melee attack against a target of your choice within 5 feet of it. The attack roll has a bonus equal to your magic ability modifier + your spellcasting  9 bonus, if any. On a hit, the target takes 3d10 force damage. Once on each of your subsequent turns, you can direct the sword to move up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a target of your choice within 5 feet of it. Directing the sword requires no action, but you must be able to take actions. This spell was invented by the famed archmage Mordenkainen, a native of the world of GREYHAWK, though it has since spread throughout the multiverse. Requirement: You must have a miniature platinum sword with a grip and pommel of copper and zinc. It costs 250 gp to construct and is not consumed when you cast the spell. </description><spell></spell><name>Move Earth</name><level>6th Level</level><school>transmutation</school><time>Casting Time: 1 action</time><range>Range: 100 feet</range><duration>Duration: Concentration, up to 2 hours</duration><description>Choose an area of terrain no larger than 40 feet on a side within Range. You can reshape earth, sand, or clay in the area in any manner you choose For the Duration. You can raise or lower the area?s elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes cannot exceed half the area?s largest dimension. So, if you affect a 40  foot square, you can create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower the square?s elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up to 20 feet deep, and so on. At the end of every 10 minutes you spend concentrating on the spell, you can choose a new area of terrain to affect. You can choose the same area of terrain multiple times to make more drastic changes to it. Because the terrain?s transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area cannot usually be trapped or injured by the ground?s movement. This spell cannot manipulate natural stone or stone construction. Rocks and structures shift to accommodate the new terrain. If the way you shape the terrain would make a structure unstable, it might collapse. Similarly, this spell does not directly affect plant growth. The moved earth carries any plants along with it. Material Components: A mixture of soils (clay, loam, and sand) in a small bag, and an iron blade. </description><spell></spell><name>Otto?s Irresistible Dance</name><level>8th Level</level><school>enchantment</school><time>Casting Time: 1 action</time><range>Range: 25 feet</range><duration>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</duration><description>Choose one creature within Range that you can see. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is not affected. On a failed save, the target begins a comic dance in place?shuffling, tapping its feet, and capering For the Duration. This spell has no effect upon undead or constructs. A dancing creature must use all its movement to dance without leaving its space and has disadvantage on all saving throws. The only action a dancing creature can take is to make a Wisdom check against the spell?s save DC to regain control of itself. On a successful check, the spell ends. If you know and use the target?s true name when you cast this spell, the enchantment instead lasts for 10 days, until you use your action to end the spell, or until the creature dies of exhaustion. The archmage Otto was a member of the Circle of Eight in the world of GREYHAWK, a lover of fine food and music, and if his eponymous irresistible dance spell is any indication, something of a practical joker. </description><spell></spell><name>Pass without Trace</name><level>2nd Level</level><school>abjuration</school><time>Casting Time: 1 action</time><range>Range: 10 feet</range><duration>Duration: 1 hour</duration><description>Choose up to five willing creatures within Range. For the Duration, the creatures can move through any type of mundane terrain?mud, snow, dust, grassland, forest, or the like?and leave no physical evidence of their passage, including footprints and scent. Tracking the creatures is impossible except by magical means. </description><spell></spell><name>Passwall</name><level>5th Level</level><school>transmutation</school><time>Casting Time: 1 action</time><range>Range: 25 feet</range><duration>Duration: 1 hour</duration><description>Choose a point on a wooden, plaster, or stone surface (such as a wall, a ceiling, or a floor) within Range. A passage appears at that point and lasts For the Duration. You choose the opening?s dimensions: up to 5 feet wide, 8 feet tall, and 20 feet deep. The opening creates no instability in a structure surrounding it. When the opening disappears, any creatures or objects still in the passage created by the spell are safely ejected to an unoccupied space nearest to the surface on which you cast the spell. Casting this spell multiple times lets you create a deeper passage. Material Components: A pinch of sesame seeds. </description><spell></spell><name>Phantasmal Force</name><level>2nd Level</level><school>illusion</school><time>Casting Time: 1 action</time><range>Range: 50 feet</range><duration>Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes</duration><description>You reach into the mind of a creature within Range that you can see, and craft an illusion that takes root in the creature?s thoughts. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you create an illusory object, creature, or other visible phenomenon of your choice that is visible only to the target For the Duration. This spell has no effect upon undead or constructs. The illusion includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli, also evident only to the creature. The illusion can appear to occupy up to 500 cubic feet, or a cube about 8 feet on a side? about the size of a typical Large creature. A target affected by this spell can use its action to try to disbelieve the illusion. When it does so, it makes a Wisdom check against the spell?s saving throw DC. On a successful check, the spell ends. While a target is affected by the spell, it treats the phantasm as if it were real. It rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the illusion. For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm will fall once it steps onto the bridge. If the creature survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists, and comes up with some other explanation for its fall?it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off. An affected target is so convinced of the phantasm?s reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the target. Similarly, a phantasm created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your turn, you can cause the phantasm to deal 1d6 damage to the target if it is in the phantasm?s area or within 5 feet of it. The damage is of a type appropriate to the illusion. A fire deals fire damage, a monster armed with a longsword deals slashing damage, and so on. Material Components: A bit of fleece. </description><spell></spell><name>Planar Ally</name><level>6th Level</level><school>conjuration</school><time>Casting Time: 10 minutes.</time><range>Range: 50 feet.</range><duration>Duration: Instantaneous</duration><description>You beseech an otherworldly entity known to you, such as a god, a primordial, a demon prince, or some other being of cosmic power for aid. That entity causes a celestial, an elemental, or a fiend loyal to it to appear in an unoccupied space within Range. If you know a creature?s true name, you can speak that name when you cast this spell to call that creature. In that case, the creature can be of any type. When the creature appears, it acts normally (that is, under no compulsion to behave a certain way). You might ask the creature to perform a service in exchange for payment. The requested task could Range from simple (fly us across the chasm, help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services. Payment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a direct gift of  1 treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a favor from you. After the creature completes the task, or when the agreed upon Duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible. Some general guidelines about payments for tasks of a certain length follow. The DM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature?s ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived.    100 gp per minute for a task taking up to 10 minutes    1,000 gp per hour for a task taking up to 24 hours     10,000 gp per day for a task taking up to 10 days Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal. A creature enlisted to join your group counts as a member of your group, receiving a full share of experience points awarded. </description><spell></spell><name>Plane Shift</name><level>7th Level</level><school>conjuration</school><time>Casting Time: 1 action</time><range>Range: Touch</range><duration>Duration: Instantaneous</duration><description>You and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in a circle are transported to a different plane of existence. You can specify a target destination in general terms, such as the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire or the palace of Dispater on the second Level of the Nine Hells, and you appear in or near that destination. If you are trying to reach the City of Brass, for example, you might arrive in its Street of Steel, before its Gate of Ashes, or looking at the city from across the Sea of Fire, at the DM?s discretion. Alternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle on another plane of existence, this spell can take you to its exact location. If the teleportation circle is too small to hold all the creatures you transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied spaces next to the circle. You can use this spell to banish an unwilling creature to another plane. Choose a creature you can touch. That creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, you touch the creature, which must then make a Charisma saving throw. If the creature fails this save, it is shunted to the plane of existence you specify. A creature so transported must find its own way back to your current plane of existence. Material Components: A forked, metal rod worth at least 250 gp, attuned to a particular plane of existence. </description><spell></spell><name>Plant Growth</name><level>3rd Level</level><school>transmutation (ritual)</school><time>Casting Time: 1 action or 8 hours</time><range>Range: 150 feet</range><duration>Duration: Instantaneous</duration><description>This spell channels life and vitality into plants within a specific area. There are two possible uses for the spell, granting either short term or long term benefits. If you cast this spell using 1 action, choose a point within Range. All normal plants in a 100  foot radius centered on that point become thick and overgrown. A creature moving through the area must spend 15 extra feet of movement for every 5 feet it would travel. You can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell?s area from being affected. If you cast this spell over 8 hours , you enrich the land. All plants within Range become enriched for 1 year. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested. </description><spell></spell><name>Polymorph</name><level>4th Level</level><school>transmutation</school><time>Casting Time: 1 action</time><range>Range: 50 feet</range><duration>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour</duration><description>Choose a creature within Range that you can see.

If the target is unwilling and its hit point maximum is lower than 150, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you transform the creature into a new form. The transformation lasts For the Duration. The new form can be any beast whose number of Hit Dice is equal to or less than that of the target. The target gains the capabilities and limitations of the new form, and loses the capabilities and limitations of its original form. But the target retains its current hit points, as well as its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The target continues to wear or carry any gear in its new form if that form is physically capable of doing so. Otherwise, the gear melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional until the spell ends.

You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.    You instantaneously clean or soil an item no larger than a cubic foot.

If it is physically broken or damaged while in this state, the creature suffers from similar damage or deformities when it reverts to its original state. 7. Violet. On a failed save, the target is blinded. At the start of your next turn, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw; a successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of the DM?s choosing. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that is not its home plane is banished to that plane, while other creatures are cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.) 8. White. On a failed save, the target is blinded for 1 minute. Additionally, roll the d8 again until you get a result other than 8, and apply that effect to the target as well. </description><spell></spell><name>Protection from Energy</name><level>3rd Level</level><school>abjuration</school><time>Casting Time: 1 action</time><range>Range: Touch</range><duration>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour</duration><description>You touch a willing creature and choose one damage type: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.

You give each target a new, illusory appearance. The spell disguises physical appearance as well as clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and appear thin, fat, or in between. You can?t change a target?s body type, so you must choose a form that has the same basic ar Rangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you. The spell lasts For the Duration, unless you use your action to dismiss it sooner. The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to a creature?s outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel the creature?s head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into something while it was seemingly still in midair. To discern that a target is disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect the target and make a Wisdom (Perception) check against the spell?s saving throw DC. If it succeeds, it becomes aware that the target is disguised. </description><spell></spell><name>Shield</name><level>1st Level</level><school>abjuration</school><time>Casting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when you are hit by an attack or targeted by the magic missile spell</time><range>Range: Self</range><duration>Duration: 1 round</duration><description>An invisible barrier of magical force, like a physical shield, appears to protect you.

Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy?s sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists. ?Associated object? means that you possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard?s library, bed linen from a royal suite, a chunk of marble from a lich?s secret tomb, or the like. On Target: You and your group appear where you want to. Off Target: You and your group appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10   1d10% of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15%, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8. On a 1, north; 2, northeast; 3, east; 4, southeast; 5, south; 6, southwest; 7, west; 8, northwest. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble. Similar Area: You wind up in an area that?s visually or thematically similar to the target area. A mage heading for her home laboratory, for example, might wind up in another mage?s laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as in her laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no Range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane. Mishap: You and anyone else teleporting with you are assaulted by the spell?s magic. You each take 1d10 force damage, and you reroll on the table to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20 + 80 instead of d100.

The creature sees in normal and magical darkness, notices secret doors hidden by magic, sees invisible creatures and objects, automatically detects visual illusions and succeeds on saving throws against them, and perceives the true forms of creatures affected by transmutation spells. Furthermore, the target can see into the Ethereal Plane. Material Components: An ointment for the eyes that costs 25 gp and is made from mushroom powder, saffron, and fat. </description><spell></spell><name>Wall of Fire</name><level>4th Level</level><school>evocation</school><time>Casting Time: 1 action</time><range>Range: 100 feet</range><duration>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</duration><description>You create a wall of fire on a solid surface within Range. You can choose to make the wall up to 30 feet long, 10 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall lasts For the Duration, and it heavily obscures creatures behind it.  6 When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 5d8 fire damage. On a success, the creature can move 5 feet so it is not in the wall. One side of the wall, selected by you when you cast this spell, deals 5d8 fire damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of that side or inside the wall, and each creature that enters the wall on its turn. The other side of the wall deals no damage. At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th Level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each Level above 4th. Material Components: A small piece of phosphorus. </description><spell></spell><name>Wall of Stone</name><level>5th Level</level><school>evocation</school><time>Casting Time: 1 action</time><range>Range: 100 feet</range><duration>Duration: Instantaneous</duration><description>A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you choose within Range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten 10 foot by 10 foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other panel. Alternatively, you can create 10 foot by 20 foot panels that are only 3 inches thick. The wall can have any shape you desire, though it cannot occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall need not be vertical, nor rest on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp. If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on. The wall can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 5, and it has 15 hit points per inch of thickness. The wall is immune to cold, fire, necrotic, psychic, and radiant damage, and is also immune to any effect that requires an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and may cause connected panels to collapse at the DM?s discretion. Material Components: A small block of granite. </description><spell></spell><name>Wall of Thorns</name><level>6th Level</level><school>conjuration</school><time>Casting Time: 1 action</time><range>Range: 100 feet</range><duration>Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes</duration><description>You create a wall of tough, pliable, tangled brush bristling with needle sharp thorns. The wall appears within Range on a solid surface and lasts For the Duration. You choose to make the wall up to 50 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has a 25 foot radius and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick. The wall blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 7d8 slashing damage. On a success, the creature can move 5 feet so it is not in the wall. A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 5 feet a creature would travel through the wall, it must spend 20 feet of movement. Furthermore, a creature that enters the wall?s space must make a Dexterity saving throw once each round it?s in contact with the wall. On a failed save, a creature takes 7d8 slashing damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage. At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of a Level higher than 6th, the wall?s length increases by 10 feet or the size of its radius increases by 5 feet and the damage increases by 1d8 for each Level above 6th. </description><spell></spell><name>Water Breathing</name><level>3rd Level</level><school>transmutation</school><time>Casting Time: 1 action</time><range>Range: 25 feet</range><duration>Duration: 8 hours</duration><description>Choose up to ten willing creatures within Range. In addition to retaining its normal mode of respiration, each creature can now breathe underwater until the spell ends. Material Components: A short reed or piece of straw. </description><spell></spell><name>Water Walk</name><level>3rd Level</level><school>transmutation</school><time>Casting Time: 1 action</time><range>Range: 25 feet</range><duration>Duration: 1 hour</duration><description>Choose up to ten willing creatures within Range. Until the spell ends, each target can move across any liquid surface?such as water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, ice, or lava?as if it were solid ground. If you target a creature submerged in a liquid, the spell carries the target to the surface of the liquid at a rate of 60 feet per round. </description><spell></spell><name>Web</name><level>2nd Level</level><school>conjuration</school><time>Casting Time: 1 action</time><range>Range: 50 feet</range><duration>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour</duration><description>You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choosing within Range. The webs fill a 20 foot radius centered on that point For the Duration. The webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure their area. If the webs are not anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet. Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them for the first time during its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free. A creature restrained by the webs can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained. The webs are flammable. Any 5 foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away at the start of your next turn. The fire spreads 5 feet at the end of each turn until the web burns away. Any creature that starts its turn in an area of burning webs takes 2d4 fire damage. Material Components: A bit of spiderweb. </description><spell></spell><name>Wind Walk</name><level>6th Level</level><school>transmutation</school><time>Casting Time: 1 minute</time><range>Range: 25 feet</range><duration>Duration: 8 hours</duration><description>You and up to 10 willing creatures within Range assume a cloud form For the Duration, appearing as nothing more than a wisp of cloud. While in a cloud form, a creature has a fly speed of 300 feet, and has resistance against damage from nonmagical weapons. The only actions a creature can take in this form are to hustle or to resume its normal form. Resuming normal form takes 1 minute. Until the Duration expires, a creature can revert to cloud form; this also requires 1 minute. If a creature is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, it descends 60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands, which it does safely. If it cannot land after 1 minute, the creature falls the remaining distance. </description><spell></spell><name>Wish</name><level>9th Level</level><school>conjuration</school><time>Casting Time: 1 action</time><range>Range: Self</range><duration>Duration: Instantaneous</duration><description>Wish is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires. The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th Level or lower. You do not need to meet any requirements. The spell simply takes effect. Alternatively, you can achieve any one of the following effects.    Create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that is not a magic item.    Create one common, uncommon, or rare magic item.    Allow up to twenty creatures to regain all hit points and end all effects on them described in the greater restoration spell.    Grant up to ten creatures immunity to a damage type, a magical effect, or some other  8 effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich?s life drain attack.    Undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent?s successful save, a foe?s successful critical hit, a friend?s failed save, and so on. You must accept the result of the reroll, even if it is less favorable to you than the original roll. You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. To do so, state your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. Your DM has a lot of latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. Either the spell simply fails, the effect you desire is only partly achieved, or you suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how the wish was worded. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item?s current owner. The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. Until you complete a long rest, you lose the ability to cast spells. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it is not 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. </description><spell></spell><name>Wrathful Smite</name><level>1st Level</level><school>evocation</school><time>Casting Time: Swift</time><range>Range: Self</range><duration>Duration: 1 minute</duration><description>Cast this spell when you hit with a melee weapon attack on your turn. Your weapon stirs up feelings of doom in your target, and the attack deals 1d6 extra psychic damage. Additionally, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the spell ends. As an action, the creature can make a Wisdom check against your spell save DC to steel its resolve and end this spell. At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd Level or higher, the extra damage increases by 1d6 for each Level above 1st. </description><spell></spell><name>Zone of Truth</name><level>2nd Level</level><school>enchantment</school><time>Casting Time: 1 action</time><range>Range: 50 feet</range><duration>Duration: 10 minutes</duration><description>Choose a point within Range. You create a magical zone that guards against deception. Until the spell ends, any creature that enters a 15 foot radius centered on that point or that starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature cannot speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw. An affected creature is aware of the spell and may thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth.</description></spell></spellbook>
